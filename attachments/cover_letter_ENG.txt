Hello!

My name is Dmitry, and I am a backend developer with over four years of experience in commercial
development.

I am interested in your company because [specify the reason: technology, product, values,
reputation]. I am particularly interested in your work on [mention the area or product], and I
would like to apply my skills to solve your challenges.

My portfolio includes projects in various fields, from veterinary medicine to HR platforms and
electronic component sales. Over the past four years, I have acquired skills that I am confident
will be valuable to your company. Among my most significant achievements in projects, the
following stand out:

* Integrated CloudPayments payment system to enable payments for initial appointments and
  donations to animal shelters.
* Accelerated electronic component search, reducing average server response time from 1.2 seconds
  to 112 ms (10x improvement) and increasing request processing speed.
* Optimized electronic component import, reducing service downtime from 6 hours to 20 minutes (18x
  improvement) and significantly speeding up database updates.

Among my personal qualities, I would particularly highlight:

* Algorithmic approach to problem-solving. I have a clear understanding of how and in what
  sequence I need to solve a particular problem, as well as what information I may be missing
  to do so.
* Ability to work in a team. If something is unclear, I make an effort to immediately clarify any
  "blind spots" with my colleagues. I am aware of team responsibility and do not try to shift
  it onto others.
* Commitment to self-development. I do not remain stagnant and continuously learn new things, from
  development tools and libraries to architectural principles and design patterns.

Additionally, my achievements include successful mentoring. Throughout my career, I have trained
more than ten people, all of whom have successfully found jobs and are fully satisfied with the
results. Moreover, I have been involved in employee certification and have experience conducting
technical interviews.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter! I would be happy to discuss how my experience can
benefit your team. I am available for an interview at your convenience. My contact information
is provided in my resume.
